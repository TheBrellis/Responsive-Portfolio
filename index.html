                <div class='bio'>Hello! My name is Brian Ellis. I currently work as a Senior Associate Engineer for Burndy LLC in Manchester NH. At Burndy, I work designing electrical connectors for grounding applications in the Utility, C&I, and OEM industries.

                        I graduated from the University of New Hampshire in 2017 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. After a couple of years in the professional world, I started to miss the pace and structure that academia provided. And so, I started to look for more avenues in which I could furthur my education and improve my career prospects.

                        While I was in school, I lived in a house with 3 Software Engineers and a Systems Engineer, so the influence of a programmers mindset was constant. I loved listening to them breakdown how they approached problems and how they constanstly had to adapt to an everchanging tech world. I was hooked. 
            I attempted to teach myself Python and Arduino, but as my schedule and priorities shifted I quickly fell out of the routine. Until I stumbled upon UNH's Fullstack Web Dev Coding Bootcamp. After some consideration I decided that it would be now or never. Longing for the structure and emersion that helped me to learn so much in college, I signed up and here we are! One website down and many more to come. I look forward to what my future in programming holds!  </p>
